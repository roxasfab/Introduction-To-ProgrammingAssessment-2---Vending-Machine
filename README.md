# For this assessment, we were given a task to create a vending machine device which includes all of its natural features such as item menu, a set of item codes dedicated for each item provided by the vending machine, and a function which allows the system to provide exact change if the paid amount is more than the actual item price. My vending machine however, features the most basic systemized function as it is focused more on printing statements to inform the user regarding their transaction status rather than applying further actions such as providing exact change and the like. This is because I have a simple objective of creating a simple yet systemized vending machine and that this will not be used for commercial purposes.
